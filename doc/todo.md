1. Theme System Enhancement
   - Add semantic classes for remaining resume sections (Work, Education, Skills, Projects, Volunteer)
   - Define appropriate Tailwind utilities for each section using `@apply`
   - Ensure consistent spacing and typography across all sections
   - Consider adding hover states and transitions for interactive elements

2. Theme Color Palette Expansion
   - Define additional CSS variables for:
     - Secondary text colors
     - Background colors for different sections
     - Border colors for dividers
     - Link colors
     - Accent colors for important information
   - Update both simple-light and simple-dark themes with these new variables

3. Layout Improvements
   - Review and enhance the container classes
   - Add responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
   - Consider adding max-width constraints for better readability
   - Ensure proper spacing between sections

4. Accessibility Enhancements
   - Add proper ARIA labels to the theme selector
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast in both themes
   - Add focus states for interactive elements
   - Consider adding a reduced motion option for animations

5. Print Theme Optimization
   - Implement the print theme CSS variables
   - Add print-specific styles for better paper output
   - Handle page breaks appropriately
   - Remove unnecessary elements in print view

6. Documentation
   - Document the theme system architecture
   - Create a style guide for the semantic classes
   - Add comments explaining the CSS variable usage
   - Document the theme switching mechanism

7. Testing
   - Test theme switching across all sections
   - Verify theme persistence across page reloads
   - Test responsive behavior with different themes
   - Verify print layout with different themes

8. Performance Optimization
   - Review CSS bundle size
   - Consider lazy loading non-critical styles
   - Optimize theme switching performance
   - Ensure smooth transitions between themes

9. Browser Compatibility
   - Test theme switching in different browsers
   - Verify CSS variable support
   - Check localStorage behavior
   - Test fallback behavior for older browsers

10. Code Organization
    - Consider splitting theme styles into separate files
    - Organize semantic classes by section
    - Create a clear hierarchy for CSS specificity
    - Document any known limitations or edge cases

Each of these steps should maintain our current approach of:
- Using semantic class names in TSX components
- Leveraging Tailwind utilities through `@apply`
- Using CSS variables for theming
- Keeping the vanilla JavaScript theme switching mechanism
