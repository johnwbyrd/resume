# Next.js Resume Website Development Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration

1. Create a new Next.js project

   - Define the color palette, typography, and spacing system
   - Create the theme context provider

10. Implement the Simple theme
    - Create light and dark variants
    - Implement system preference detection
    - Build toggle functionality

11. Develop the Elegant theme
    - Design sophisticated typography and layout
    - Implement subtle color accents
    - Optimize spacing and visual hierarchy

12. Create the Retro VT-100 theme
    - Implement monospace typography
    - Design terminal-style interface with 80-column layout
    - Add appropriate colors and possibly subtle CRT effects

13. Build the Print theme
    - Optimize for physical printing
    - Handle page breaks appropriately
    - Create printer-friendly styling
    - Add print-specific elements

14. Implement the theme switcher component
    - Create the UI for theme selection
    - Build theme preview functionality
    - Add transition effects between themes
    - Implement theme persistence with localStorage

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

15. Add PDF generation functionality
    - Implement PDF export capability
    - Ensure formatting consistency
    - Create download button/functionality

16. Implement Google Analytics
    - Configure GA4 with Next.js
    - Set up custom events for theme switching
    - Add performance monitoring

17. Optimize performance
    - Configure image optimization with next/image
    - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
    - Optimize for Core Web Vitals

## Phase 5: Build and Deployment

18. Set up GitHub repository
    - Initialize with proper branch structure (main and stable)
    - Configure Git hooks for code quality checks
    - Add documentation

19. Create GitHub Actions workflow
    - Configure build process for Next.js
    - Set up branch-based deployment logic
    - Add testing and validation steps

20. Configure deployment to staging environment
    - Set up stage.johnbyrd.com deployment from main branch
    - Implement proper caching and compression
    - Configure SSL

21. Set up production deployment
    - Configure www.johnbyrd.com deployment from stable branch
    - Implement additional security measures
    - Set up monitoring and alerts

## Phase 6: Testing and Refinement

22. Perform cross-browser testing
    - Test across modern browsers
    - Verify in text-based browsers
    - Validate mobile experience

23. Conduct accessibility testing
    - Verify screen reader compatibility
    - Test keyboard navigation
    - Ensure sufficient color contrast in all themes

24. Performance testing
    - Run Lighthouse assessments
    - Test on low-end devices
    - Optimize any bottlenecks

25. Final review and documentation
    - Document theme system
    - Create update instructions
    - Prepare handover documentation

## Development Notes

- Prioritize semantic HTML and accessibility throughout development
- Use progressive enhancement to ensure functionality without JavaScript
- Implement the theme system early to avoid rework
- Test each component with each theme to ensure compatibility
- Focus on performance optimizations from the beginning
- Keep SEO considerations in mind for all content-related components
- Document code thoroughly as development progresses

This plan provides a structured approach to building the resume website with Next.js,
focusing on implementing core functionality first and progressively adding more
advanced features. The theme system is central to the design and should be considered
in every step of component development.
